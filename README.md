# Zubr Website

A static website for Zubr, an AI-driven plant detection company focused on agriculture and land management. This site is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## About Zubr

Zubr builds AI-driven plant detection tools for agriculture and land managers. We combine handheld near-infrared (NIR) analyzers for hay bale screening with drone-based hyperspectral mapping for noxious weed detection (e.g., invasive annual grasses like ventenata). We help hay producers, ranchers, and weed programs detect contamination early, map infestations, and prioritize treatment.

## Site Structure

The website includes the following pages:

- **Home** (`index.html`) - Landing page with hero, benefits, and how it works
- **Products** (`products.html`) - HayGuard™, FieldScan™, and SpectraCloud™ products
- **Technology** (`technology.html`) - Technical details on detection methods
- **Use Cases** (`use-cases.html`) - Real-world applications
